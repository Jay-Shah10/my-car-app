                The McLaren F1 is a sports car designed and manufactured by British automobile manufacturer McLaren Cars, and powered by the BMW S70/2 V12 engine. The original concept was conceived by Gordon Murray. Murray was able to convince Ron Dennis to back the project. He engaged Peter Stevens to design the exterior and interior of the car. On 31 March 1998, the XP5 prototype with a modified rev limiter set the Guinness World Record for the world's fastest production car, reaching 240.1 mph (386.4 km/h),[4] surpassing the modified Jaguar XJ220's 217.1 mph (349 km/h) record from 1992.

At the time it was Ferrari's fastest, most powerful, and most expensive car for sale.[14]</p>

                The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its sixth generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.

                The Subaru WRX is an all-wheel drive sport compact car manufactured by Subaru, originally based on the Impreza created for the World Rally Championship in 1992.[1] Subaru claimed the name WRX stands for "World Rally eXperimental". Since 2014, the WRX lineup has been split from the Impreza, with a different body style also being used for WRX models.[2] After this point, there has been an absence of a hatchback/wagon body style.
